# Delegated driver example

This is the project directory of a [molecule scenario without a driver (called a delegated driver)](molecule/default). ie
* the [create](molecule/default/create.yml) 
* and [destroy](molecule/default/destroy.yml) 
playbooks have to be created.

It's a copy of the [online docker example](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/examples/docker/).

> [INFO]
> Normally, using docker, you would use the docker driver.
