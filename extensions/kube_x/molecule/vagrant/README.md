# Vagrant Scenario

## Halas

Because of the Docker error, we tried vagrant. Halas, there is no vagrant in our Docker Execution Environment.
Stopped the experiment there.

## Why Vagrant?

`k3s-ansible` uses full fledge virtual image with [Vagrant](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s-ansible/blob/master/Vagrantfile)
and `vagrant` is a [driver for molecule](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule-plugins/tree/main/src/molecule_plugins/vagrant)
