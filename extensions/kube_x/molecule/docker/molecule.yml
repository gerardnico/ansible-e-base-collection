# Instance to create (manage the type of distribution CentOS, Fedora, Debian)

platforms:
  # These properties are literally read by tasks in `create.yml`
  # It's a property of community docker
  # * name is the name of the container
  # * image ...
  # You could have more than one image started
  # The command is hard written as `sleep 1d`
  #
  # There is also a docker driver which is completely other thing
