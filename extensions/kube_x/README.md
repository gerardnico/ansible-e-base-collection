# Molecule scenario

## Molecule Project directory

This is the molecule project directory for the `kube_x` playbooks.
* [](../../playbooks/kube_x_site.yml)

Normally this is the `role` but in our case. There is no role.

> [WARNING] 
> Molecule can not be run from the collection project directory.
> Otherwise, it will reinstall the collection and messed up practically everything.
