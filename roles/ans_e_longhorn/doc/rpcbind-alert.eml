Dear Mr Nicolas GERARD,

We have received a notification from the German Federal Office for Inform=
ation Security (BSI) for (the IP address of) a server you have with us. W=
e are automatically forwarding this notification on to you, for your info=
rmation.

The original report has been included below. Additional information is pr=
ovided with the how-to guides referenced in the report. Please note that =
we do not have any further information to share.

These notifications do not mean your server was involved in any abusive a=
ctivity. They are simply alerting you to a potential issue on your server=
, that could be exploited, and that is usually fairly easy to secure.

You do not need to send us, or the BSI, a response.

In case of further questions, please contact certbund@bsi.bund.de and kee=
p the ticket number of the original report [CB-Report#...] in the subject=
 line. Do not reply to <reports@reports.cert-bund.de> as this is just the=
 sender address for the reports and messages sent to this address will no=
t be read.

Kind regards
